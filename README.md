# Dapp

This code is for a basic decentralized application (dApp) that interacts with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract has two functions: getMood and setMood.


HTML Structure: The HTML part of the code creates a simple user interface with two buttons for getting and setting the mood, and an input field for the user to enter their mood.


CSS Styling: The CSS part of the code styles the HTML elements. It centers the text, sets the font, and styles the div and button elements.


JavaScript: The JavaScript part of the code does the following:-
It includes the ethers.js library, which is a library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
It defines the address and the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the MoodContract. The ABI is an array that describes how to interact with the contract’s functions.
It creates a new instance of the ethers.js library’s Web3Provider object, which allows the dApp to connect to the Ethereum network.
It sends a request to the Ethereum network to get the user’s accounts.
It creates a new instance of the ethers.js library’s Contract object, which represents the MoodContract.
It defines two asynchronous functions, getMood and setMood, which interact with the getMood and setMood functions of the MoodContract respectively.



note in the code:

The line const MoodContractAddress = "Your Contract Address"; needs to be replaced with the actual address of the deployed contract. Without the correct address, the dApp won’t be able to interact with the contract.

Note: Make sure that the contract is deployed on the same network (e.g., mainnet, ropsten, rinkeby, etc.) that the dApp is connected to. Also, ensure that the user has enough Ether in their account to pay for gas fees when interacting with the contract. If the user doesn’t have enough Ether, the transactions will fail.
